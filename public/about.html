<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="/4.1+Webpages/assets/images/fb profile pic.jpg" height="200">

<p>My name is Angie, I'm 48 years old and live in South Wales.  I have a black cat called Sid (short for Obsidian) 
  and he is my little prince.</p>

<p>We travel around the UK in our campervan, working at festivals and events, during the summer.  We love travelling and 
  meeting new people, finding new places and adventures.</p>

<p>I am learning to code to hopefully find a new career path that i enjoy and that has longevity.  I would like to travel 
  and code from anywhere, building websites or apps and maybe become an AI Programmer.</p>
