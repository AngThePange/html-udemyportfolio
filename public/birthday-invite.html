<h3>What to bring:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Glitter (I love sparkles!)</li>
  <li>Gluten Free Cake (I'm really good at eating cake but have a sensitivity to wheat)</li>
  <li>An appetite (There will be plenty of food and drinks...especially if everyone brings cake!)</li>
  <li>Most importantly, your lovely selves</li>
</ul>
